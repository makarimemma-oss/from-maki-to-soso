  <h1>Open When You Miss Me ðŸ’Œ</h1>

  <div class="letter">
    <p>I miss my lover too.<br>
    I'm sure I miss you now because I always do.<br>
    I'm probably doing something in life to ensure I will one day have you.<br>
    I miss the days when I will hold you in my arms.<br>
    I miss the future of us.</p>

    <p>Will I be able to pull my hand from yours once I hold it?<br>
    Will I notice the color of the sky after I meet your eyes?<br>
    Will I notice where we stand the moment I feel your breath?<br>
    Will I notice what we wore the second our bodies are intertwined?<br>
    Will I notice the time when I figure out your hair's color?<br>
    Will I know I ever existed the moment I finally get to call you my love?</p>

    <p>I miss you with me by my side. I miss you in my daily plans.<br>
    I miss you near me. I miss you when you are far.<br>
    I hate whatever's keeping you away from me.<br>
    I hate whateverâ€™s keeping me away from you.<br>
    I wish to have you and hide you all to myself.</p>

    <p>You are always my baby when away, when far.<br>
    Always my love when you sleep, my love when you are awake.<br>
    Always my Sara that I miss and wish to be stuck to at any chance.</p>

    <p>I could feel my heart racing each time I thought of finally meeting you.<br>
    Would time slow down when our lips first meet?<br>
    Would the world fade away when you whisper my name?<br>
    Would I remember how to breathe when you smile at me like that?</p>

    <p>I miss the weight of your head on my chest.<br>
    I miss the way your laughter will fill our home.<br>
    I miss our lazy Sunday mornings that haven't happened yet.</p>

    <p>I carry you in every heartbeat.<br>
    In every decision I make, I'm building a life worthy of you.<br>
    In every lonely night, I'm one day closer to never being lonely again.<br>
    In every breath, I'm practicing how to say "I love you" in a thousand different ways.</p>

    <p>Until then, I'll keep missing you.<br>
    Until then, I'll keep becoming the person who deserves to hold you.<br>
    Until then, know that somewhere, always, I am yours before we've even met.</p>

    <p>I miss you writing this. I miss you always.</p>
