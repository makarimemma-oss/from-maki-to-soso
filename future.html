    words of all langauges are still not enough to describe you.
  </p>
  <p>
    How do I hold you when you're this far? A way from me, away of my love, can the heavens open their gate?
    Maybe there I'll find words enough to do you justice things.  
    Oh, to get a wish, to get a kiss, to get a chance to hold your hands.  
    I love the way we speak, the way time slips away ‚Äî just a step closer to the promised day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Can I cling to you until then? Can I know all about your day, every detail, every plan?  
    Until then, I shall sit here, consuming whatever you lay in my hands.  
    Can I hear your voice when the night feels long?  
    Can I be the reason you stay strong?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let me be the one who understands your fears, who celebrates your joys and dries your tears.  
    I want to learn the rhythm of your heart, to know each beat, each pause, each precious part.  
    I could spend weeks, months, and years talking about really anything ‚Äî sleep and wake up
    just to ask your opinion on everything silly or the possibility of a second dimension breaking.
  </p>
  <p>
    i love the time i had with you , i have with you and will have with you,
    every words we exchange every slient we breath every memory we create
    from all the questions we share to all the answers we discuss to the views on the world we wonder about
    i love us the clinginess, the understanding , the love, the talk , our time, our happiness,our dreams, everything 
  </p>
  <p> - we will be okay , i love you so much, i love us so much</p>
